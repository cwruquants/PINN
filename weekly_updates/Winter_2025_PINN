1) Pick assigned model out of the three papers (make sure you are implementing the Black-Scholes model for European Options)

2) Read the paper thoroughly, write down assumptions, model parameters, and implementation details, 
this is for your reference but also for our final report. (pay attention to sampling methods, and PDE details like collocation points)

3) Implement your model, Louskous-thesis is a great reference (in the Appendix he lists his code), once you have implemented it,
compare to what was written in the paper and benchmark against analytical solutions to BS (using Mean squared error most likely 
or whatever is in the paper).

4) Data visualization: it'd be nice to have visualizations for loss function and payoff diagram, some papers include their own
visualization, compare these.
